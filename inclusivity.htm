		<h3 class="center" id="retuning">Retuning songs</h3>
			<p class="center">When a song is retuned, you have to retune your instrument slightly to make it sound correct<br>This can be irritating as it is usually a small change that cannot be done by ear<br>This does not include tuning the instrument themselves down to a different tuning to reach lower notes</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 class="center" id="tabs">Official tabs/sheet music</h3>
			<p class="center">We will produce official ones written by the player themselves to make sure they are as accurate as possible<br>They will also be free<br>This does not stop other people from making their own tabs/arrangements - please go ahead!</p>
		<hr>
		<h3 class="center" id="diversity">Diversity</h3>
			<p class="center">We actively support people of all backgrounds, identities, and beliefs through our music and actions</p>

		<h3 class="center" id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
			<p class="center">This website was made within strict guidelines of accessibility standards<br>This means it is fully navigable by only keyboard, only mouse, usable by screen reader, and eyetracker<br>It also uses the least Javascript it needs to reduce loading times</p>
